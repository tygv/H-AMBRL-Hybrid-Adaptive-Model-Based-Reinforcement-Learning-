# Hybrid Adaptive Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (H-AMBRL)

This repository contains the implementation of **Hybrid Adaptive Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (H-AMBRL)** for optimizing fast-charging protocols in lithium-ion batteries. The model integrates **Gaussian Process Regression (GP), Neural Networks (NN), and Random Forest (RF)** to enhance the charging efficiency while ensuring battery longevity.

## âš¡ Dataset

### **1. Hardware-Based Dataset**
The hardware dataset consists of real-world battery charging data collected under different conditions.

**Features included:**
- **Voltage (V)**
- **Current (A)**
- **State of Charge (SoC)**
- **Remaining Capacity (Ah)**
- **Cycle Index**
- **dV/dt**

The dataset is stored in the `datasets/` folder and is used by `hard_vs_trad_v3.py`.

### **2. Online Dataset**
For additional real-world data, we use the publicly available dataset from **Matrian**:
ðŸ”— **[Online Dataset](https://data.matr.io/1/projects/5c48dd2bc625d700019f3204/batches/5c86bd64fa2ede00015ddbb3)**

#### **Channels Used:**
The model is trained using the following channels:
7, 9, 10, 11, 26, 31, 38, 39, 44, 46
