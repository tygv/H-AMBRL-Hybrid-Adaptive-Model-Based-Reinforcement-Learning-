# Hybrid Adaptive Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (H-AMBRL)

This repository contains the implementation of **Hybrid Adaptive Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (H-AMBRL)** for optimizing fast-charging protocols in lithium-ion batteries. The model integrates **Gaussian Process Regression (GP), Neural Networks (NN), and Random Forest (RF)** to enhance the charging efficiency while ensuring battery longevity.

## ðŸš€ Features
- âœ… **Multi-Model Learning**: Integrates GP, NN, RF to improve fast-charging predictions.
- âœ… **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Implements PPO-based reinforcement learning.
- âœ… **Real & Simulated Data Support**: Uses both **hardware-based** and **online-based** datasets.
- âœ… **Data Processing & Visualization**: Generates **plots**, **learning curves**, and **feature importance**.

## âš¡ Dataset
The datasets contain battery parameters collected under different charging conditions:
- **Voltage (V)**
- **Current (A)**
- **State of Charge (SoC)**
- **Remaining Capacity (Ah)**
- **Cycle Index**
- **dV/dt**

To use the datasets:
1. Download them from the `datasets/` folder.
2. Ensure CSV files have the required columns.
3. Run the scripts to train and evaluate the models.
